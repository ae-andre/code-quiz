# Code Quiz

## Description

A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores to track progress.

The questions chosen are intended to challenge beginner-level coders on Javascript fundamentals.

In planning the design, I chose a layout that gave enough space between elements to ensure that all content was readable and easy-to-understand.
